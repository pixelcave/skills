description: Add CodedVisuals visual compositions to a React marketing or landing page. Use when the user wants an animated coded visual (charts, hero, bento, feature block, dashboard, chat, code editor, avatars, integrations, and more) in their project, when picking which visual fits a section, or when installing, importing, and customizing one. This is the entry point; each visual also has a reference file at visuals/{category}/{file}.md.

# Using CodedVisuals

CodedVisuals is a library of marketing visuals built as self-contained React components. Each visual is a single `.tsx` file with no shared dependencies between visuals, styled with shadcn/ui design tokens and animated with Motion. They are decorative illustrations for marketing and landing pages (heroes, bento grids, feature blocks, product explainers), not interactive app UI.

This is the entry point. It covers how to pick a visual, get it into the project, and use it. Every visual also has a reference file bundled with this skill at `visuals/{category}/{file}.md` (for example `visuals/charts/line.md`), with that visual's exact props, default content, and copy-ready examples. Read that file once you know which visual you want.

## How to work with a visual

1. **Pick a visual** from the catalog at the end of this file. Each entry has a registry name, a description, and the reference file to open next.
2. **Open the visual's reference file** (`visuals/{category}/{file}.md`) for its props, defaults, and examples.
3. **Make sure it is installed** in the project (next section). This skill is not tied to what is installed, so a visual you pick may not be in the project yet.
4. **Import and use it** inside a sized container (see "Use it on a page").

## Install a visual if it is not in the project

The project may have this skill without having every visual installed. Before using a visual, check whether its file already exists under the project's source root:

```
components/codedvisuals/{category}/{file}.tsx
```

The exact root varies by project (for example `src/` in a Vite app, `resources/js/` in a Laravel app). If the file is there, just import it. If it is not, add it one of two ways.

### Install with the shadcn CLI (recommended)

CodedVisuals ships a private shadcn registry. After a one time setup (below), install any visual by its registry name, which is `{category}-{file}`:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @codedvisuals/charts-line
```

The CLI drops the file into `components/codedvisuals/` and installs Motion and lucide-react if they are missing. Other package managers work the same way: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add ...`, `yarn shadcn@latest add ...`, `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add ...`.

#### Set up the private registry (one time)

The registry is private, so it needs a CodedVisuals account with an active license and a personal registry token. This is configured once per project, and it requires actions only the user can take (purchasing, signing in, copying a secret), so guide the user through these steps rather than attempting them yourself.

1. **Get a license and issue a token.** Sign in at [codedvisuals.com](https://codedvisuals.com) (buy a license first if needed), then open Settings, Registry token, and issue a token. It is shown only once, so copy it right away.
2. **Add the registry to `components.json`** with a `registries` entry that reads the token from an environment variable:

   ```json
   "registries": {
     "@codedvisuals": {
       "url": "https://codedvisuals.com/r/{name}.json",
       "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${CODEDVISUALS_TOKEN}" }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Expose the token** in the project's `.env` (or shell environment):

   ```bash
   CODEDVISUALS_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```

After this, `npx shadcn@latest add @codedvisuals/{category}-{file}` works for any visual in the catalog. The Settings, Registry token page also shows these exact `components.json` and `.env` snippets prefilled, and is the authoritative source if the registry URL ever differs from the above.

### Copy and paste

Signed in members can copy a visual's source or download its file from its preview page, then drop it into `components/codedvisuals/{category}/`. On this path you install the dependencies yourself: Motion and lucide-react.

### Projects without shadcn/ui

Visuals expect four things from the host project: the `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` utilities, a `cn()` helper at `@/lib/utils`, the shadcn/ui design-token CSS variables, and an `@` import alias pointing at the source root. A shadcn/ui project already has these. For a plain React + Tailwind CSS v4 project, follow `manual-setup.md` in this skill, then copied files work unchanged.

## Use it on a page

A visual fills its parent, so wrap it in a box with a height:

```tsx
import ChartsLine from "@/components/codedvisuals/charts/line";

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div className="h-96 rounded-2xl border bg-card">
      <ChartsLine animated />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The default import name is the consumer's choice; `{Category}{File}` in PascalCase (for example `ChartsLine`) is a safe convention.

## Animation

Animation is opt-in through three props:

- `animated` turns motion on. Without it the visual renders in its final, static state.
- `trigger` decides when the entrance plays:
  - `mount`: animate as soon as the visual renders.
  - `inView` (default): animate once when it scrolls into view.
  - `inViewRepeat`: replay every time it scrolls back into view.
- `hover` enables hover micro-interactions on visuals that support them.

```tsx
<ChartsLine animated trigger="mount" />
<ChartsLine animated trigger="inViewRepeat" hover />
```

Omit `animated` entirely for a completely still illustration.

## Presentation modifiers

Most visuals accept marketing-ready modifiers. They are optional:

- `gradient` (default `true` when supported): a soft brand glow behind the visual.
- `fadeOut` (default `false`): fade the bottom edge into the background.
- `isometric` (default `false`): a subtle 3D tilt.

```tsx
<ChartsLine animated isometric fadeOut />
```

## Data props and defaults

Visuals are data-driven. Beyond the shared props above, each visual takes its own typed props (copy, values, icons, counts) to customize appearance and content. Every prop is optional and falls back to a sensible default, so pass only what you want to override. The exact props, their types, defaults, and examples live in each visual's reference file under `visuals/`. When in doubt, the installed `.tsx` file is the source of truth: its props `interface` and `DEFAULT_*` values show the full API.

## Theming and accessibility

Visuals read the project's shadcn/ui tokens, so they match the brand with zero configuration. Change the `--primary` token and every visual updates; toggle the `.dark` class and they switch to dark mode. The Tailwind palette is only used for small supportive accents, never the core brand surfaces.

Visuals are decorative: the outer container is `aria-hidden`, so do not rely on them to convey information to assistive tech. Pair a visual with real text content in the surrounding section.
